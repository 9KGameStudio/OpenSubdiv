All three subdirectories contain source that is completely new and additive
to the existing OpenSubdiv source.  I haven't included any of the translation
from FarRefineTables to FarMesh at this point, so there is nothing stale or
that might create conflicts.

See the OVERVIEW.txt file in each subdirectory for an overview of its contents.

There have been minor revisions to the "sdc" source since last sent (though
none really of note) and this version includes a full "sdc" subdirectory with
.cpp files, not just the headers.
